## COVID-19 Research Paper Analysis

I had previosuly developed a method for unsupervised topic clustering called [Adjutant](https://github.com/amcrisan/Adjutant). THe purpose of Adjutant was to provide a quick, initial, set of clusters that can be used to orient an individual with a large document corpus. I have applied Adjutant here to the analysis of research papapers about COVID-19, which was [shared on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge).

My goal is using Adjutant is to provide additional context to these researchers papers. 

## How to use this data

I am hoping the individuals that need better overviews of the data will find Adjutant's clusters to be of use on your analysis. I am also working on identifying clusters that could be aligne with kaggle's tasks.

I've uploaded the reuslting clusters as a CSV file that augments the metadata file shipping with the kaggle data set. I am updating this information as dig into the data myself.
